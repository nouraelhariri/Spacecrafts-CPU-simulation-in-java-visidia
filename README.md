# Spacecrafts-CPU-simulation-in-java-visidia-
The Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and Dragon are very advanced spacecrafts,  but once they got in orbit they face challenges.
1) The overheating of 120 C and cold of -150C, depend if they are facing sun or not .
2) The radiation comes from high-energy particles that are ejected by our sun, that causes whats called a bit flip.
in this video we demonstrate 3 node, each one represent a cpu in spacecrafts
in code source you will find a random delay ( to simulate a error in cpu ) and how they work with each other to synchronise clock to get right Ecliptic latitude & longitude of the moon
